# Takwimu Dashboard

Wordpress-powered backend for Takwimu.AFRICA. Includes chart creation tools, snippets manager, Gutenberg blocks for WYSIWYG editorial interface, and elasticsearch integration. Main site accessible at https://takwimu.africa/

## Development
We use docker-based environment for development making use of [wordpress](https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress/) and [mysql](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) docker images.

To get started, clone this repository and spin up docker-containers as shown below. Refer to [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/TakwimuAfrica/Dashboard/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file

```shell
git clone git@github.com:TakwimuAfrica/Dashboard.git
cd Dashboard
docker-compose up
```

Once containers are up, visit `http:localhost:8080` and follow instructions for further installation of wordpress.

Takwimu Dashboard uses a custom react javascript plugin called `hurumap`. HURUmap plugin allows you to define `HURUmap charts`, `Flourish Charts`, & `Chart Sections` and enable you to add charts to post/page content using [gutenberg editor](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/).

`hurumap` build file is enqueued to the admin screen during activation. So we have to build `hurumap` code before we can activate it on wordpress.

```shell
cd wp-content/plugins/hurumap
yarn build
```

You can now navigate to wordpress dashboard `http:localhost:8080/wp-admin` and log in.

Once you're logged in,

1. Activate `hurumap` theme under `Appearance` -> `Themes` from wordpress dashboard menu. 
2. Activate `hurumap` plugin under `Plugins` dashboard menu.
3. Because the plugin URL structures are pretty, make sure your wordpress `Permalink` Settings is also set to a pretty-link option (wordpress default permalinks is ugly i.e `http://example.com/?p=N`)
4. Activate/Install other plugins you will need for your development (i.e `custom posts`, `advance custom fields`, `ACF to REST API`)
5. All done! You can now add content, use and customize plugins.

### Elasticsearch
Takwimu Dashboard uses elasticsearch to enhance wordpress search functionality along with the [elasticpress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elasticpress/).  For local development, we make use of the es server docker container. Once docker containers are up (i.e `docker-compose up`) you can visit `http:localhost:9200` 

1. Activate `ElasticPress` plugin on dashboard
2. Go to the plugin settings and add your elasticsearch host url i.e `http://es:9200` on `Third-Party/Self-Hosted` menu
3. Save changes and follow instruction to index your content.
4. Once content is sync, you're ready to use search.
